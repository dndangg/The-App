## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. WhatsApp: Read indicators, system agnostic, storage saving media upload options
2. Google Photos: Automatic backups, cloud storage, collaborative albums
3. AnyDesk: System agnostic, remote access and control of devices

An app that I would be interested in building would be an app where I can add and revoke access to a physical location through the use of a pin entry. My security system would allow me to set a master pin for the door and set temporary pins that I can give out to authorized users. These users would have accounts that they have registered to my database. The app would have a login and based on the level of authority the account has, different portals will be seen. For example, most people would only see the pin code they are provided. On the other hand, I would be able to manage giving access to and revoking pin codes.
 
## Notes

At first, I accidentally added the labels and button for both the launch page and the main page. After noticing it while testing, I removed the additions to the launch page in order to match the instructions of the project.
